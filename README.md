# Brevard-Systems

## Project to create a site to edit Laurence Brevard Consulting computer assets.

The goal is to manage computers and other assets more easily than in a spreadsheet with too many rows.
Additional assets to add are:
* Printers
* Network hardware
* IoT devices

## Requirements

1. Create a database with the information from the Brevad_Computers.xlsx spreadsheet.
2. Provide an editable TABLE view akin to the spreadsheet
3. Provide a NOTES section with the information below the table in the spreadsheet.
4. Provide an editable FORM view with one page per row in the table
